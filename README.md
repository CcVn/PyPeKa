# PyPeKa
A foulish attempt to make a PK (then maybe PBPK) program in Python (for learning Python purpose)

This is public despite my very poor skills, because making it private requires a paid account ...

My primary goal is to translate a huge script I made in a defunct Matlab competitor software (acslX, RIP) to pilot PBPK models coded in the CSL langage used by this software (the script was written in a version of the M langage, the Matlab langage)
As a noob in Python, and to avoid reinventing the wheel, I have looked first for other examples made in Python (found more or less nothing), in R (found some packages that might be used as inspiration guide) and Matlab (found only one script, limited to PK models, but object-oriented and very appealing to me because written in an industrial context).
